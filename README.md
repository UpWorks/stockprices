# StockPrices
Starter App for iOS Swift Tutorial

Over the next few weeks the class will turn this app into a clone of the Apple's iOS Stocks app.

The app relies on Core Data, Apple's object graph management and persistence framework along with [AlamoFire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire), the swift port of [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking).

If you will be participating in the class and do not have access to a Mac, [MacInCloud](http://www.macincloud.com/) is an affordable VMWare/Physical Mac Server cloud service.
